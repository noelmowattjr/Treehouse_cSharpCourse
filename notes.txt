Access Modifiers
	private - only accessible to methods in the same class that they are declared in
	public	- can be accessed by any method and any class

readonly	- when prepended to a variable, it makes the variable unchangeable after 		it has been created.

Learned: Today I learned how to create a custom type. I created a class named Point and instantiated it as a variable taking two int values to which i then passed this point instance as argument in my OnMap method. This is amazing that I finally figured out how to create a custom class/type and utilize it! I must try this on my own after I break!

	I feel I have a better understanding of static vs non-static methods.
	Static methods can called on the class directly (or without in custom cases) vs 	non-static methods which require us to instantiate the class 1st and then call the 	method on the instantiated object.
