Access Modifiers
	private - only accessible to methods in the same class that they are declared in
	public	- can be accessed by any method and any class

readonly	- when prepended to a variable, it makes the variable unchangeable after 		it has been created.

Learned: Today I learned how to create a custom type. I created a class named Point and instantiated it as a variable taking two int values to which i then passed this point instance as argument in my OnMap method. This is amazing that I finally figured out how to create a custom class/type and utilize it! I must try this on my own after I break!

	I feel I have a better understanding of static vs non-static methods.
	Static methods can called on the class directly (or without in custom cases) vs 	non-static methods which require us to instantiate the class 1st and then call the 	method on the instantiated object.

	Truncation
	To shorten or to cut off part of. In computer programming hereâ€™s my example of 		when I may want to truncate my answer.
	
	double height = 5.01;
	
	if I just wanted my output to just be a 5 int I may write something like:
	int myHeight = (int) height;
